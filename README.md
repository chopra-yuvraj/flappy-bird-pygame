## Why Flappy Bird Game?
As a B.Tech CSE student at VIT and B.S Data Science student at IIT Madras, 
I wanted to understand game development fundamentals and physics simulation.
Also, my friends and I love competing in simple games during study breaks!

### Key Features
- **Simple Controls** - Just spacebar to jump and navigate
- **Physics Engine** - Realistic gravity and jump mechanics  
- **Collision Detection** - Precise pipe and ground collision system
- **Score Tracking** - Points for each pipe successfully passed
- **Game States** - Start screen, gameplay, and game over modes
- **Smooth Animation** - 60 FPS gameplay for fluid bird movement
- **Auto-Restart** - Quick restart functionality to play again

### Game Modes
| Control | Action | Best For |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **SPACE** | Make bird jump | Main gameplay control |
| **SPACE** | Start new game | Beginning each session |
| **R** | Restart after crash | Quick retry after game over |

### Track Your Progress
- **Live Score Display**: See your current score in real-time
- **Personal Best**: Challenge yourself to beat your high score
- **Instant Feedback**: Immediate game over when you hit obstacles
- **Simple Metrics**: Focus on improving pipe-passing count

---

## Future Enhancements
Ideas for future versions (keeping it simple):
- [ ] **Sound Effects** - Jump sounds and background music
- [ ] **Better Graphics** - Sprite images instead of basic shapes
- [ ] **High Score Persistence** - Save and load personal records
- [ ] **Difficulty Levels** - Varying pipe gaps and speeds
- [ ] **Themes** - Different backgrounds and pipe colors
- [ ] **Mobile Version** - Touch controls for smartphones
